# Sparkademy Frontend Assignment

#### Requirements
- NodeJS version >= v10

Technologies used: React, Typescript, Antd (UI Framework) and Jest/React Testing Library.

This project is a frontend application with a simple form to be validated as following:

- All fields are required
- Email should be a valid email in the form of "email@domain.com"
- Age should be a numeric value (0-99)
- Website should be a valid host name (http://domain.com)

1. You should not use Antd's built in input validation features, you should write your own validation logic.

To start the app:
```
yarn start
```

There's a set of failing tests which needs to pass.
To run all tests:
```
yarn test
```

Feel free to write more tests!! 💪🧑‍💻🚀
